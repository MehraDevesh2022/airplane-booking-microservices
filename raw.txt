# requirment analysis
 - functional requirement => over all system functionality
 - non funcational requirement => what we expect from the system like  
   - performance
   - security
   - usability
  
# non funcational requirment
 - we can expect more flight searches than bookings
 - The system should be reliable in terms of bookings
 - Expect that we will have more than 1,00,000 users signed up
 - 1,00,000 bookings might come in a quarter
 - In one day we might be getting 100 bookings
 - System should be able to make sure that we dont change the price of a flight after the user has booked it
    when then booking paymnet is going on
 - System should be able to auto scale itself for atleast 3x more traffic



- Flight service
